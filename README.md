# 🧠 Operating Systems Project – Shell & Banking Transaction System

This repository contains two major projects built using C++ for the **Operating Systems** course:

1. **Shell Simulation** – A custom Unix-like shell supporting advanced features like pipelining and process management.
2. **Banking Transaction Processing System** – A multithreaded banking system demonstrating concurrency, synchronization, and resource management.

## 🧩 1. Shell Simulation (`ShellScripting.cpp`)

This part of the project implements a custom shell interface that processes commands, manages pipelines, handles errors, and uses `fork`, `execvp`, and inter-process communication for process control.

### ✔️ Features Implemented

* 🔹 Standalone & Parameterized commands (`ls`, `ls -l`, `date`, `cp src dest`)
* 🔹 Input parsing with `strtok`
* 🔹 Error handling for invalid or empty inputs
* 🔹 Process creation using `fork` & `execvp`
* 🔹 Synchronization using `wait()`
* 🔹 Single and multiple pipelining (e.g. `ls | wc`, `ps aux | grep code | wc -l`)
* 🔹 Pipe handling using `pipe()` and `dup2()`

### 📚 OS Concepts Applied

* ✅ Process Management & PCB
* ✅ Inter-Process Communication (IPC)
* ✅ Shell Interface & Input Handling
* ✅ Synchronization & Pipelining
* ⚠️ Partial Memory & Address Space Concepts
* ⚠️ Partial Security Concepts (command validation)

## 🏦 2. Banking Transaction System (`BankingTransactionProcessing.cpp`)

This project simulates a **realistic banking environment** where multiple transactions (deposits, withdrawals, transfers) occur simultaneously. The system ensures **integrity, security**, and **performance** using core OS concepts.

### 🔧 Features & Functionality

| Feature                        | Description                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 💼 **Multithreading**          | Uses POSIX threads (`pthread`) to handle concurrent transactions.                                 |
| 🔐 **Synchronization**         | Mutexes & condition variables prevent race conditions and ensure safe access to shared resources. |
| 📦 **Shared Memory**           | Account data and logs are managed using shared memory concepts.                                   |
| 🧠 **Priority Scheduling**     | Transactions are prioritized (VIP, Critical, High, Medium, Low).                                  |
| 🔁 **Dynamic Task Assignment** | Tasks are assigned based on system load, transaction type, and priority.                          |
| 🧱 **Resource Simulation**     | Simulates ATM limits, teller availability, network delays, and outages.                           |
| 🛑 **Fraud & Error Handling**  | Handles overdraws, fraudulent access, and auto-locking on suspicious activity.                    |
| 🔁 **Load Balancing**          | Uses Least Recently Used (LRU) strategy to distribute processing load.                            |
| 📅 **Business Rules**          | Peak hour handling, dynamic scaling of workers during high load.                                  |

## 🧪 Compilation Instructions

Use `g++` to compile the programs as follows:

```bash
# Compile the shell program
g++ ShellScripting.cpp -o shell_sim

# Compile the banking system (with threading)
g++ BankingTransactionProcessing.cpp -lpthread -o banking_sim
```

---

## 📌 Usage Examples

### 🔧 Shell

```bash
./shell_sim

> ls -l
> ps aux | grep firefox | wc -l
> cp file1.txt file2.txt
```

### 🏦 Banking System

```bash
./banking_sim

# Simulates customers performing transactions in real-time
```
